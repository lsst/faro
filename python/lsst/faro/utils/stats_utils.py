def calcQuartileClippedStats(dataArray, nSigmaToClip=3.0):
    """Calculate the quartile-based clipped statistics of a data array.
    The difference between quartiles[2] and quartiles[0] is the interquartile
    distance.  0.74*interquartileDistance is an estimate of standard deviation
    so, in the case that ``dataArray`` has an approximately Gaussian
    distribution, this is equivalent to nSigma clipping.
    Parameters
    ----------
    dataArray : `list` or `numpy.ndarray` of `float`
        List or array containing the values for which the quartile-based
        clipped statistics are to be calculated.
    nSigmaToClip : `float`, optional
        Number of \"sigma\" outside of which to clip data when computing the
        statistics.
    Returns
    -------
    result : `lsst.pipe.base.Struct`
        The quartile-based clipped statistics with ``nSigmaToClip`` clipping.
        Atributes are:
        ``median``
            The median of the full ``dataArray`` (`float`).
        ``mean``
            The quartile-based clipped mean (`float`).
        ``stdDev``
            The quartile-based clipped standard deviation (`float`).
        ``rms``
            The quartile-based clipped root-mean-squared (`float`).
        ``clipValue``
            The value outside of which to clip the data before computing the
            statistics (`float`).
        ``goodArray``
            A boolean array indicating which data points in ``dataArray`` were
            used in the calculation of the statistics, where `False` indicates
            a clipped datapoint (`numpy.ndarray` of `bool`).
