I chose the above to start with because it has non-NaN values for all the
measurements I wanted to test.

The process I chose was to copy the matched catalogs for r and i from the above
patch. These are single band single patch matched catalogs. I used `gzip` to
compress them and read them in directly using `SimpleCatalog` in the test.

The script `shrink_cat.py` can be used to further reduce test data size. It
takes the input catalog as the first argument and the output catalog as the
second. It has a list of field names that should be preserved and attempts to
set all others to zero. Flags are read only, but should compress well anyway.

I also copied the persisted `Measurement` objects for the corresponding bands
and patches. These can be read in using `yaml.load`.
